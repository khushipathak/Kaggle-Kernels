# Kaggle-Kernels
Repository containing markdown versions of my Kaggle .ipynb kernels

Visit my [Kaggle profile](http://kaggle.com/khushipathak) for a complete list of all my submissions.

Each markdown file in this Github repository contains a link at the top for the original Kaggle submission, while will also lead to the data used for the project.

Please leave upvotes on the Kaggle kernels if you liked them!
